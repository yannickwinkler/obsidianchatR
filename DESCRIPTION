Description: Provides functions to extract structured content (annotations, notes, abstracts, citekeys) 
    from Obsidian literature notes, particularly those imported from Zotero. 
    It facilitates the creation of prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) 
    by combining these notes with sections from R Markdown manuscripts. 
    The package thus allows to quickly draft academic texts.
